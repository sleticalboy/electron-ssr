# ShadowsocksR cross-platform client

[中文](./README-CN.md)

`ShadowsocksR` is a cross-platform desktop client with support for Windows, macOS and Linux. It is feature-rich, supports most of the features of the Windows version and has more user-friendly features. It is open source, is based on open source projects and gives back to the open source community.

## Note for Linux user

By default the `libsodium` maybe not get installed on some platform, for example, the `Fedora`, you can install it manually by command `dnf install libsodium`.

On some systems that use `Gnome` desktop, except `Ubuntu 18.04`, may not have the `AppIndicator` installed, you can manually install this [plugin](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) to fix it. (or find it in the store's Add-ons-Shell Extensions)

## Configuration file location

- Mac `~/Library/Application Support/electron-ssr/gui-config.json`
- Linux `~/.config/gui-config.json`

## Shortcuts

The shortcuts were originally added to solve the problem that some Linux distributions cannot display the icon in the top bar. Therefore its content menu cannot be used. Of course on other systems the shortcut can be turned off in the settings.

### Global shortcuts

- `CommandOrControl+Shift+W` show/hide main window
- `not assigned` switch system proxy mode

### In-app shortcuts
- `CommandOrControl+Shift+B` show/hide the menu bar, only available on Linux

## Known Bugs

- Some Linux systems cannot switch system proxy mode. This application uses `gsetting` to set the system proxy, so some Linux systems cannot use this feature. If you know how to implement it, please feel free to create an issue.
- Switching the global system proxy on Windows fails
